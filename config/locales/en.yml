# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

    texttitle: <b>How it`s made</b>
    text: |
       <b>1. NBS website.</b>
       -  Since the APR website cannot be scraped headlessly, first step was to scrape all possible tax identification numbers in Serbia on the National Bank of Serbia website.
       -  Every positive hit, that returns current account number,returns a uniform registry number (MB) and tax identification number (PIB) as a combination.
       -  This info is saved in sql table.
       -  Technologies used - Mechanize. It took aprox. 1.5 months to try several milion numbers. Data gathered was around 170.000 of valid MB numbers.
       -  NBS website doeasnt have a good ban policy for this kind of scraping.
       <b>2. Next is scraping of APR website.</b>
       -  APR uses JS for search fields, so Mechanize wouldnt do. Capybara + phantomjs were used for headless scraping.
       -  Each page set was defined with SitePrism. A page set coresponds with type of company.
       -  APR webiste has much better protection. In addition to JS, it temporary bans the apps adress, for aprox. 24 hours.
       -  In each turn, it allows only about 100 pages to be scraped from one adress. This part took the longest. Three apps were used, local and cloud. Approx. 8 months for 65.77% coverage of cca. 170.000 companies according to official data.
       <b>3. Cleaning raw data.</b>
       -  Data had to be extracted using regular expressions, and saved to new mysql database.
       -  It was easier to upload raw file to app, and then to add every file 1 by 1.
       <b>4. Presentation.</b>
       -  Again data had to be reorganized to match criteria of network visualization software.
       -  Cytoscape is used for complete network images.
       -  Cytoscape.js is used in-app for graphic representation of single searched entities and their connected entities.
       -  Out of 111k companies, only around 30% are used for onepic-graph of economy, because of memory and cpu limits.
